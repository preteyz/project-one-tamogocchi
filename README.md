User Story:
1. Naming my character/maybe eventually having a character selection screen
2. Have player moves that interact with each other
3. graphics follow a certain theme. If there are too many clashing themes it might look strange (if it doesn't look nice it isn't worth playing)
4. There must be a clear endgame, but also a way to rack up points/levels or have a leaderboard.
5. Instructions should provide details on how each choice interacts with each other.
6. Must have some sort of reward system so that the game has some replayability (can i beat my previous run?)
